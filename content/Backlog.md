Posts to write:
1. Large / multi-part post on Errand lang.
    - What the goals are, why those goals (problems w other languages or possible improvements)
    - How I'm going about trying to reach those goals
    - Current progress & roadmap
2. Large post on Multivectors
	- Why they're actually extremely simple
	- How most of math and science makes many concepts way more complicated than they ought to be
	- Why we should stop constraining ourselves to just vectors, and embrace multivectors
3. Using multivectors as structured tensors for ML
4. High level ideas for making small-faster-smarter language models
    - Separate Knowledge, reasoning, and language production.
    - Multi-part
        - Knowledge / memory
            - It's bad that LLMs remember so much in many cases (Reference Jack Morris talk?)
            - Hard to make knowledge dynamic / teach it new things / re-prioritize existing concepts
        - Reasoning
            - Reasoning is often more abstract than simply CoT
        - Language production / understanding
            - Language is an interface for thought, not thought itself.
            - Plenty of smart people and animals that are completely incapable of standard language production.
5. Computational complexity thought from college
6. Finish multiple dispatch is an API post
7. Finish Lossless invariant functions post
8. Maybe a post about Pluto notebooks as APIs?
