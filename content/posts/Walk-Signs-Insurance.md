Government provides small insurance policies constantly. Once such example is walk signs. The key however is that you don’t pay with money, you pay with ***time***! Every time you want to cross an intersection and you don’t see any cars coming, but the walk sign still has that orange hand telling you to stop, you have two options:

- Ignore the sign and cross anyways
- Wait until the sign says you can cross

By paying with your time and waiting for the sign to change, the government _insures_ that you have certain rights if a car comes blazing through the red light which you don’t have otherwise. (i.e. right to sue for compensation)

This works because it is not only fantastic insurance, but it’s also incredibly affordable as practically everyone has those few seconds to spare. Additionally, it is quite an equitable method of payment as all citizens have the exact same amount of time (not necessarily in a lifetime of course, but no-one earns time faster than others).

If you know of other instances like this, reach out and I’ll add them below!
