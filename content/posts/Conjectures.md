Every problem that can be mapped to a graph domain doesn’t have to suffer from curse of dimensionality since all graphs can live in 3D 

Generalized Understandings/Intelligence is made of two components:
- Structured Representation 
- Learned information
	- many statistical have this, but lack a structured representation 


The computational complexity of a function is proportional to the amount of information it  observes
