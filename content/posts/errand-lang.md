This is a multi part post about the programming language I’ve been working on in my free time called [Errand](https://github.com/eliaslittle/errand) (lang).

[Part 1 - Why another language?]({{< relref "errand-1-why-another-lang" >}}): Why I thought there was a need for a new language and what it aims to do
  
Part 2: Design: How this language will try to solve these problems
  
Part 3: Progress & Roadmap: What's been written so far, and what's next
