Periodic shapes
5 equally spaced points.
Traverse 1 to the next to the next —> Pentagon
Skipping one each time gives —> Star
Skipping two each time gives —> Star traversed backwards
Skipping 3 each time gives —> Pentagon traversed backwards
Skipping 4 gives —> point (miss other points)
Skipping 5 == skipping 0


Any divisors enter a degenerative state that don’t hit every vertex.
