## Howdy 👋🤠

I'm Elias, I'm a software engineer currently living in SF.
I spend a lot of my time thinking about machine learning and programming languages, keeping up with current state of the art research and techniques.

I am also currently open to work, so if you think I might be a good fit for your team please reach out<cite>[^1]</cite>.
[^1]:Email me at: \<firstname\>jlittle \<at\> gmail.com

Most recently I was a Founding Engineer at [Nectar Climate](https://nectarclimate.com/). 
I worked on everything from designing and implementing the first status tracking system, to building scrapers, and a slew of fullstack work including building many internal tools and iterating on our client dashboards.

Before that, I was a Strategy and Product Specialist at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com). A multidisciplinary role, most akin to a Technical Project Manager.
I spent time on four different teams: Reconciliation Dev Team, Central Risk, Bookings Pipeline, and the Options Desk.

Prior to Jane Street, I was a student at Cornell University. 
I got my Bachelors there, where I studied Computer Science and focused largly on machine learning and math. 
I was heavily involved with [Cornell Data Science](https://cornelldata.science) and was the President my Senior year.



If for whatever reason, you want to chat, you can reach out to me via Twitter (or whatever it's called now).
